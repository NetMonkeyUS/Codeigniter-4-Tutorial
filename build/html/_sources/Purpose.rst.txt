Purpose: Why another tutorial?
==============================
The tutorial that comes with the `Codeigniter User Guide <https://codeigniter4.github.io/userguide/tutorial/index.html>`_ leaves a lot to be desired. It can get you started, but there is not a lot of 'why' in the 'what' they instruct you to do. The end result (if you're lucky and resilient) is that you get a Codeigniter 4 installation working on a local environment, but you don't really fathom how you did it and good luck taking it any further

Experts are not the best teachers
---------------------------------
I am not a web design expert. I'm more of a shade-tree developer, but I have found that in web development and other endeavors, experts are not always the best teachers. Often times people who have more recently learned things remember how rocky the path was to the mountaintop, while those who have been living there a long time have forgotten the frustration of getting there.

Codeigniter 3 is not Codeigniter 4
----------------------------------
You would think Codeigniter 4 is just an improvement and extension to Codeigniter 4. Unfortunately that is not the case. While Codeigniter 4 might be considered a cousin to Codeigniter 3, it should not be considered a direct descendent. The reason for this is that when you 'Google' to find a solution to a problem you are having, if the resolution was made for Codeigniter 3, it probably won't work in Codeigniter 4. Codeigniter 4 was restructured for better security, and as a result a lot (read: most) of solutions that work in CI3 just won't cut it in CI4.
	  
Comprehensive guide 
-------------------
The problem with the CI4 tutorial is that while it can help you get started on a local site, it abandons you when it comes to information on going live. You will find yourself bobbing back and forth between the tutorial and other documentation because there are so many information wormholes. The CI4 tutorial is just a remapping of the CI3 tutorial with no improvements or enhancements. You would think after all these years they would build on what they started instead of just slapping a new coat of paint on it.
	  
Learning tips
-------------
People learn by doing. If you just copy and paste the code snippets, you will only get a surface knowledge. My suggestion is to type out as much as you can stand. The code will fail more than half the time due to typos, but if you can find the error it will be a learning opportunity. Quite often I end up copying and pasting, but I only do it as a last resort with code that is not working
